# pyvolley

Application made in Python (PySide6) to model a Volleyball match and store detail statistics in database (sqlite3). 
To do that there is an engine and a script to scrap (BeautifulSoup) and store data about Teams, Players and Games. In current stage it's only about PlusLiga, polish professional league.

**This is just an early stage of development!**

In the future it may be used with API or as Python library.
