# pyvolley

Application made in Python (PySide6) to model a Volleyball match and store detail statistics in database (sqlite3). 
To do that there is an engine and a script to scrap (BeautifulSOup) and store data about Teams, Players and Games. 

In the future it may be used with API or as mobile App.
